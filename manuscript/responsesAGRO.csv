From my basic understanding scientific investigation forms from the foundation of the scientific method which is used by scientists to explore and investigate in order to answer questions about the world around us.

If you were a researcher you would understand that it's a systematic process of acquiring knowledge and new understandings through problem solving and a series of trials and error. I believe that science happens by having curiosity and being able to question things around you.

I didn't fully understand if they meant the largest line in general or in comparison between the 2 lines that they were asking you to choose which was smaller. So the way in which things were worded was a source of error. ","The variables were the shapes and the line sizes. The line size is quantitative because you can measure the distance of each line but it could also be categorical because they were categorized by small or large. The shapes were categorical between triangle and circle. ","I think the control groups were if you were a stats 218 student or not. It was not exactly a randomized group of people because I am assuming it was anticipated for college students but it could be for anyone but information is not given. If you were to do the entire population then that would be a different experimental design. But for the sake of this experiment I believe it was random college students who were either in stats 218 or not. There can be a wide range of considerations such as age, educational, level, and college courses. ","After reading the extended abstract it was a lot clearer about what exactly the methods were for this study. I know know that visual depth is one of the factors that went into the study along with 3D and 2D models. I was not aware beforehand that there were different kits that had different comparisons. What I am wondering is what the other kits have in them. I also want to know exactly if I was doing it right because it was discussed in the abstract that 3D printed things can be misguided. In a way that helps me understand the point of the study, but I am interested to see the results. ","Throughout this project I would say I gained more information about what a study might look like when conducting it was a population who knows nothing about why they are doing it. I was very confused as a participant and I feel that is good because you can get a more accurate reading. The post-study I was able to reflect on what I did and be able to see it from a statistical viewpoint. The abstract informed be about how the study was conducted and went over the methods. The presentation I got more background knowledge about why they wanted to conduct the study and how it all came together along with the results. I also learned about what the research question was. ""How do 2D and 3D charts compare to one another?"" I learned about the overall goal and was able to understand the study more. I also got an answer to a question in which I asked back in the post-study which was ""Who was involved in this study?""

I was wondering exactly the point of each step but as I have completed everything it is much more clear. ","From this presentation it was a lot more clearer than the abstract. The abstract was kind of vague from my point of view. From this presentation it went over everything nicely and provided visuals which help me understand the study better. It went over the values and the comparisons they used to make assumptions. The presentation also went over the findings of the study and provided answers to some of the questions. I learned about what the different kits looked like and what was in them. In the abstract they did discuss the different kits but I didn't fully understand what they looked like. There were also statistics that were more detailed than the abstract. The results were interesting to look at and see where I was at throughout each step of the study.","I think that the questions and the directions were extremely vague during the beginning of the study. I had no idea what I was doing the whole time. The technology also got messed up a few times when trying to get into the study. The 2D and 3D bars were not showing up for the longest time until I refreshed my browser. I also did not fully understand the scale in which I was rating the size of the smaller bars. ","If I had to only hear about the study from either the abstract or the presentation I would prefer the presentation because it was more direct and went over the results in a condensed way with lots of visuals. Personally, I don't enjoy reading abstracts without all the information. It is easier for me to look at an abstract after I know all the information but that is just me. I think the presentation lets me know all the different design elements of the experiment and they were able to justify each part.

Procedural because participants may be confused about how to answer the question. Although there was an introduction with examples, the wording was still confusing. There were also no instructions on how to zoom in and out or move the interactive models around. This could leave some people not able to gain the full experience of the model and lead to an error. ","2D bar graphs vs 3D bar graphs = Categorical 

The difference in size comparing two bars = Quantitative 

What bar was smaller, triangle or circle = Categorical 

Other factors that could have been tested: Gender (Categorical), Age (Quantitative)","For a control group, it (could have) shown 3 examples of the question on how the slider works. Randomization was used in the types of graphs offered, the lengths of the bar graphs, and/or which one was bigger or not (triangle vs circle). ","As I put in the hypothesis for this experiment, I thought they were testing that 3D models aided in better comparison than 2D models, however, now I know they were trying to test the opposite. In my opinion, this makes more sense as I thought it was harder to interpret the 3D models compared to the 2D models. One thing I would suggest for future experiments, if I may, is to include how to use the 3D models. I think having instructions or a short video on how to move and look at the 3D model will create better results with fewer sources of error.

To allow for a more accurate conclusion. ","They differed as they built on each other. With the participation, you did not know exactly what was being tested but you could take an educated guess.

The abstract has only so many words for what the experiment is, how it was completed, and the results. The presentation was able to emphasize the experimental procedure that one did but also how the results were calculated and gathered. I think that it was like this because it is easier to emphasize these things in a presentation as compared to the abstract, or paper. This is because you can easily show pictures and explain it. ","I do not have much critique about this study and design. It seems really thought out. The only suggestion I have, as mentioned in my other responses, is to show how to work with 3D models. Putting participants with no experience with 3D models can be hard to get accurate results. I would suggest putting some notes or a short video on how to move the models. This will allow participants to more accurately show if 3D models are less than 2D models. I would also suggest expanding this experiment further than just statistics students. This is a very niche group and for more unbiased results, use students of UNL. ","I would suggest the presentation. This is because it is more engaging for the viewer but allows one to see the experiment step by step. The presentation walks through from begging to end. It allows emphasis on the experiment procedure, how it works, the calculations for results, and interpretation better than what the abstract offers. "

* the 3-D graphs catagorical

I also felt that the post-experiment reflection and the extended abstract differs because the abstract gives you the details and the reflections asks you to inturpert those details. ","The presentation gave a background on 3-D graphics, I like how it included the background and went over things such as the development of graphics in Microsoft excel. The presentation went over the results of the study and how those results can be interpreted and used for students experiential learning. ","I think that to make the study a little better it could have went over why your answer to the questions impacted the results of the study as well as maybe showed a trend, where if the answers were incorrect, show the most common answer.

Scaling is important when creating graphs, and it can be misleading to the participant or reader if there are discrepancies between graphs that may be displaying the same information. I also understand why using different graph types shows that there are differences in how the data is displayed and how that can make it difficult to determine how the participant takes the information or how they read the data. Discrepancies in graphs can lead to a lack of validity in results, which can be bad for experimenters, so a study like this is important to see how participants read the results from different graphs.

I think it would make the study even better and provide better results between analyzing the different graphs if the researchers set it up so that participants looked at a 2D graph and then immediately a 3D graph, back and forth, and so on. It would even be beneficial if they showed the same data in the two different graph types back to back that way researchers could really see how the two different graphs are analyzed and if there is a significant change in 2D to 3D analysis. ","I personally would prefer the extended abstract because it provides exactly what the experiment is trying to study, with extra information on how it connects to the Cleveland and McGill experiment, and how the limitations are being met. I think the extended abstract is better for determining whether the experiment is well-designed.

Some questions I still have is how could these results aid in the designing of graphics for the visually impaired or how does the sampling population represent them? ","The information I gained from the extended abstract and presentation was certainly more detailed easier to understand. It became more obvious to me as to what I was being tested on and the purpose of the study in the post-study reflection. However, the practice run before the actual experiment test was helpful. ","Components emphasized in the presentation were the purpose of the study and what was being experimented on. This was likely not emphasized in the abstract to avoid any bias or sway of decisions during the participation process. ","Some critiques I have of this study and its design are the specific way in which they collected sample units. I am not sure that either sampling populations would be representative of an entire population or able to be generalized further. The participatory nature of collecting sample subjects may turn out in an oversampling of one population so there should be a larger and more random way of getting a new sampling population. ","If I had to hear about this study I would prefer the presentation because the visual components of results helped me to better understand. However, I feel that the extended abstract provides better information for determining if the experiment was well designed because it better explains the study being replicated. "

I think that a researcher has to do much more thinking about the experiment they are going to do, and think of all the possibilities that could happen (good or bad). Whereas a consumer of the scientific results has all of the information handed to them in a way that they can choose what to do with that new information. Researchers have a very specific process and questions they have to answer within their experiment whereas consumers of this research are able to form their own opinions on what they choose to believe based on the results of what the experiment has already given them. ","brainwash-paradigm-spiderlike-transshaped","To see how humans are able to perceptualize different graphs ","How accurate humans are at guessing the differences of bar height in graphs","There was no numbers on the slider when guessing how much smaller the bar was, it made it hard for me to know if I was accurately putting it in the right place or not.

 ","the variables were:

which bar was perceived as smaller: categorical 

how much smaller the bar was to the taller one: quantitative","there was a use of random graphs (to me) and colors presented to me, I also think they could have been put in a random order for each person doing the experiment. 

the treatment group would be the STAT 218 students participating in this experiment

I think the control group would be the people who did not choose to do this study, because for this case you either had to do the experiment or you did not do it. 

random selection of results could also be used to compare each persons answers

 

 ","Some components that are clearer now is why they are doing this experiment. It was to show the difference between 2D and 3D graphs and how they are perceptualize in different environments. Another thing that was clearer is that there are 21 kits of graphs for this experiment which allowed for each combination of the different ratios they used for comparison to be observed. Another thing that was helpful to learn about from the abstract was that they said that research shows that data comparisons are less accurate in a 3D chart than a 2D chart. A question I still have is how did they know what height to use for each bar and each set of bars? Like is there research done that tells us what makes it harder/ easier to visualize height difference in both 2D graphs and 3D graphs? ","As I went throughout each step of this project, I was continuing to learn more information about the study itself. Each aspect helped me learn something about how the experiment was done, or more of the math used to figure out the data given. It also helped me to be able to think about what I did on the experiment to compare to the answers other people gave/ the data that has been collected so far. ","In the presentation there was a visualization of each kit that was not in the abstract, they also included many more equations in regard to the math that was involved from the study. I think this is easier to talk about than it is to write about, and are able to explain it more efficiently. Also, in an abstract, there is only a limited amount of information people want to put in there in order to not give all of the study information in the abstract itself. ","I think something that could have made this study better is maybe reducing the combinations of ratios that were put out in the study. Less ratios could allow for more people to do the experiment, but not have such overwhelming data to go through in regards to figuring out the hypothesis.","I would prefer the presentation. I think that maybe the abstract would be better for determining whether the design of the experiment was better because of the fact that it strictly lays out the experiment and some of what math was involved, whereas even though the presentation did that, it went more in depth about the results as well instead of just the design. "
