              conducting statistical investigations from data collection, to
              exploring data, to statistical inference, to drawing appropriate
              conclusions. We focus on genuine research studies, active
              learning, and effective use of technology. In particular, we use
              simulation and randomization tests to introduce students to
              statistical inference, yielding a strong conceptual foundation
              that bridges students to theory-based inference approaches, which
              are presented throughout the book. Th is approach allows students
              to see the logic and scope of inference in the first chapter and
              to cycle through these ideas, too oft en lost to introductory
              statistics students, repeatedly throughout the course. Our
              implementation follows the GAISE1 recommendations endorsed by the
              American Statistical Association''--",
